Work done during master thesis on robot communication through movement and the impact of 
different movements on the perception of objectives.

Literature shows that wider more readable movements (legible movements) are better at conveying 
intent to people and direct more expected movements (predictable movements) are better at not surprising people.

Worked composed by three modules:
	- vision module to capture location of the movement targets
	- movement module to generate movements in the robot using ProMPs
	- social module to interact using explicit communication
